-- | The Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test.
--
-- This test calculates the sum of ranks for the given two samples.  The samples
-- are ordered, and assigned ranks (ties are given their average rank), then these
-- ranks are summed for each sample.
--
-- The return value is (W&#8321;, W&#8322;) where W&#8321; is the sum of ranks of the first sample
-- and W&#8322; is the sum of ranks of the second sample.  This test is trivially transformed
-- into the Mann-Whitney U test.  You will probably want to use 'mannWhitneyU'
-- and the related functions for testing significance, but this function is exposed
-- for completeness.

-- | The Mann-Whitney U Test.
--
-- This is sometimes known as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test, and
-- confusingly many sources state that the Mann-Whitney U test is the same as
-- the Wilcoxon's rank sum test (which is provided as 'wilcoxonRankSums').
-- The Mann-Whitney U is a simple transform of Wilcoxon's rank sum test.
--
-- Again confusingly, different sources state reversed definitions for U&#8321;
-- and U&#8322;, so it is worth being explicit about what this function returns.
-- Given two samples, the first, xs&#8321;, of size n&#8321; and the second, xs&#8322;,
-- of size n&#8322;, this function returns (U&#8321;, U&#8322;)
-- where U&#8321; = W&#8321; - (n&#8321;(n&#8321;+1))\/2
-- and U&#8322; = W&#8322; - (n&#8322;(n&#8322;+1))\/2,
-- where (W&#8321;, W&#8322;) is the return value of @wilcoxonRankSums xs1 xs2@.
--
-- Some sources instead state that U&#8321; and U&#8322; should be the other way round, often
-- expressing this using U&#8321;' = n&#8321;n&#8322; - U&#8321; (since U&#8321; + U&#8322; = n&#8321;n&#8322;).
